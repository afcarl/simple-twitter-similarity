USAGE:

REQUIREMENTS:
    * python-twitter:
        easy_install python-twitter
    http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/
    (This package, in turn, requires simplejson)

NOTES:
    * This will only work on public timelines. We don't do authentication.

    * We only use as many twitter updates as GetUserTimeline returns,
    with count=200. In the future, one might want to keep reading the
    user's timeline until it is exhausted, the get the ENTIRE timeline.

    * Smoothing is a technique whereby we improve recall. There are
    several ways we could smooth the data:
        * By default, we preprocess the tweets solely using
        string.split. This preprocessing will lead to poor recall,
        since it does not handle variations in inflection, case, and
        punctuation. More sophisticated preprocessing could improve
        recall, and would include lowercasing, stemming, and improved
        tokenization. If you have package pytextpreprocess installed
        (http://github.com/turian/pytextpreprocess), you can get
        sophisticated preprocessing by using program option:
            --preprocessing=pytextpreprocess

        * Every time we see a twitter username referenced, we could
        take the representation of that referenced user and mix it in
        with the representation of the referencing user. In particular,
        every word uttered by the referenced user could be normalized to
        a probability distribution. Referncing this user is equivalent
        to uttering the referenced user's probability distribution.
